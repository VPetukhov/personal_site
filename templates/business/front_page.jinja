        I hold a PhD in Biostatistics, during which I developed <a href="https://github.com/VPetukhov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8 open source packages</a> used by thousands of researchers worldwide. I also worked as a Data Science Team Lead, and then as an independent AI consultant, mastering translation of business needs into technical terms. Combining scientific and enterprise experience, I can support your company on the full spectrum from formulating a business problem to building a production-ready AI solution.
